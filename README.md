# Introduction to thermal engineering

This introduction covers the fundamentals of thermodynamics required to model
technical thermodynamic systems at the example of heat pumps. The course
applies the theoretical concepts using Python codes and covers an introduction
to fluid property models, different approaches for modeling component based
thermodynamic systems and the implementation of such models in an open source
framework, i.e. [TESPy](https://tespy.readthedocs.io). Check out the course
[here](https://fwitte.github.io/intro-to-thermal-engineering/).

The course is an open source project developed by
[Francesco Witte](https://github.com/fwitte). You are invited to contribute to
the project!

## Structure of the Tutorial

The tutorial is separated in three chapters:

1. Brief introduction to the fundamentals in context thermal modeling
2. Application of two approaches to model full systems, e.g. heat pumps
3. Using the process simulation software tespy to perform the same tasks

Every chapter has a section with a couple of exercises, where you can
implement the models with python code.

## Preconditions for Participants

The course employs python to model the heat pump systems. In order to complete
it, you have to install python on your machine. With that done, you will
need a virtual environment with a couple of dependencies installed to execute
the python code. You can follow the instructions provided on the
[TESPy documentation](https://tespy.readthedocs.io/en/main/installation.html).
On top of that, you can use something like
[jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for interactive
code development and execution.
