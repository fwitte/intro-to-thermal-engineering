    "In the technical systems investigated in this workshop fluids (liquids or gases)\n",
    "flow through individual components and therefore change their state\n",
    "continuously. By determining the thermodynamic state of a fluid at the inlet and\n",
    "at the outlet of every component in the technical system and knowing all\n",
    "components' properties we can determine the performance of the complete system.\n",
    "Therefore, this section outlines how to determine the state of a fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "To simplify things, we are only considering pure fluids. The fluid might be\n",
    "gaseous and liquid at the same time (in the two-phase state), but we will not\n",
    "consider mixtures of different fluids.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Describing the thermodynamic state\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe the state of a fluid through various properties, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "- pressure $p$,\n",
    "- temperature $T$ and\n",
    "- density $\\rho$ or specific volume $v=\\frac{1}{\\rho}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases it is sufficient to measure two of these three properties to\n",
    "determine the third using physical models. For example, if you measure the\n",
    "pressure and the temperature of water, you can mathematically determine the\n",
    "density. Or, if you measure density and pressure, you can determine the\n",
    "temperature. However, pressure and temperature are not sufficient to determine\n",
    "every state of the fluid. The {numref}`thermo-isobaric-evaporation` shows the\n",
    "change of the state of a fluid when heat is added continuously in an isobaric\n",
    "(at constant pressure) process.\n",

    "\n",
    "Assume, the cylinder only contains liquid water. While transferring energy to\n",
    "your system, the temperature of the water has reached the boiling point at some\n",
    "point (the boiling point temperature depends on the pressure of the system). At\n",
    "that point, the water is in the so-called *saturated liquid* state. If you\n",
    "continue to transfer heat to the water, you will notice, that the temperature\n",
    "does not change, but part of the water will evaporate. This state is called\n",
    "*two-phase* because both liquid and gaseous state are present. Only when the\n",
    "last drop of water evaporated (this state is called *saturated vapor*) the\n",
    "temperature of the steam will start to increase again if you transfer more\n",
    "energy to the fluid. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "These physical models for fluid properties can be very simple, i.e. for\n",
    "so-called *ideal gases*, or they can be very complex. In our course we will use\n",
    "complex models, but the good news is: Others have implemented the algorithms and\n",

    "\n",
    "Apart from the three state variables pressure, temperature and density, other\n",
    "state variables can be of interest. For a number of connected open systems, as\n",
    "they are typically present in technical plants for heat provision, it is\n",
    "important what amount of energy is transported into the system and what amount\n",
    "is transported out of each subsystem to assess the overall performance. A fluid\n",
    "itself always transports energy, therefore we need another state variable to\n",
    "account for energy in such systems. For open systems, this property is the\n",
    "mass-specific *enthalpy* $h$. The enthalpy describes the energy required per\n",
    "mass of a fluid to change the state while flowing through an open system.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "h=f\\left(p,T\\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, mass specific entropy $s$ is used to describe the state of a\n",
    "fluid. The entropy is useful for detecting whether processes are reversible or\n",
    "irreversible or for component benchmarking. First, there are three\n",
    "fundamental principles for entropy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Entropy can never be destroyed.\n",
    "2. Entropy is generated in thermodynamic non-ideal (*irreversible*) processes.\n",
    "3. Entropy can be transferred together with heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these relations we can use the entropy for process benchmarking. For\n",
    "example, in a component with an adiabatic process, the entropy does not change\n",
    "if the process is thermodynamically ideal because neither is it generated nor\n",
    "can entropy be transferred with heat transfer. You would find such a process in\n",
    "a compressor or in a turbine. We can now benchmark our real world component with\n",
    "this ideal process and assess the optimization potential in our component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, we can prove, why heat transfer can never be reversible: To transfer heat\n",
    "from one object to another object or from one fluid stream to another fluid\n",
    "stream, a temperature difference must be present, since heat always is \n",
    "transported from high temperature to low temperature. The entropy transported\n",
    "together with heat depends on the temperature level of the heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\dot S_\\text{Q} = \\frac{\\dot Q}{T}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we transfer a specific amount of heat e.g. from a stream of water to a stream\n",
    "of air, the total amount of heat delivered by the water would be received by the\n",
    "air stream. Therefore, {math}`|\\dot Q_\\text{water}| = \\dot Q_\\text{air}`. Since\n",
    "the temperature of the water must be higher than the temperature of the air, we\n",
    "can see that the entropy removed from the water stream is lower than the entropy\n",
    "received by the stream of air.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to enthalpy, entropy can be expressed as function of pressure and\n",
    "temperature or pressure and specific volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "s=f\\left(p,T\\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For *reversible* processes an easy relationship can be made between entropy,\n",
    "enthalpy and the other state variables can be made:\n",
    "\n",
