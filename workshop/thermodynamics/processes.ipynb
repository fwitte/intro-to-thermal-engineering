    "from the energy transferred via work or heat. Furthermore, since we want to\n",
    "balance systems in steady state, the derivative to time is used, i.e.:\n",

    "- heat transfer $\\dot Q$ in `W` or `J/s`\n",
    "- work rate $\\dot W$ in `W` or `J/s`\n",
    "- dissipation energy rate $\\dot W_\\text{diss}$ in `W` or `J/s`\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat and work may be transferred to the system and that changes the states of\n",
    "the inflowing and outflowing fluids. We will assume, that neither kinetic nor\n",
    "potential energy of the fluid will change, when the fluid passes the system, or\n",
    "the change is negligibly small in comparison to the change of enthalpy.\n",
    "In {numref}`thermo-open-system-energy` $o$ denotes outlet streams and $i$\n",
    "denotes inlet streams. The general energy balance of the thermodynamic open\n",

    "One of the main challenges now lies in the identification of heat and work\n",
    "transfer given a change of state. The following section will outline, how this\n",
    "can be achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we observe a change of state in a mass flow between the inlet and the outlet\n",
    "of a system, we cannot make any conclusions back to the process taking place in\n",
    "the system. For example, we might see enthalpy not changing between inlet and\n",
    "outlet. Without further knowledge on the system's attributes, we cannot know\n",
    "what processes happened. Work could be transferred into the system and the same\n",
    "amount of heat could be withdrawn. However, if we knew that we have an adiabatic\n",
    "system, we could conclude that no work is transferred as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we have a closer look at simple processes typical for open systems,\n",
    "which may help us create a direct connection between a change of state and\n",
    "process energy. Work rate can be calculated:\n",
