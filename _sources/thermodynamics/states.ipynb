    "# Thermodynamic states\n",
    "\n",
    "In the technical systems investigated in this workshop fluids (liquids or gases)\n",
    "flow through individual components and therefore change their state\n",
    "continuously. By determining the thermodynamic state of a fluid at the inlet and\n",
    "at the outlet of every component in the technical system and knowing all\n",
    "components' properties we can determine the performance of the complete system.\n",
    "Therefore, this section outlines how to determine the state of a fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "To simplify things, we are only considering pure fluids. The fluid might be\n",
    "gaseous and liquid at the same time (in the two-phase state), but we will not\n",
    "consider mixtures of different fluids.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe the state of a fluid through various properties, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "- pressure $p$,\n",
    "- temperature $T$ and\n",
    "- density $\\rho$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases it is sufficient to measure two of these three properties to\n",
    "determine the third using physical models. For example, if you measure the\n",
    "pressure and the temperature of water, you can mathematically determine the\n",
    "density. Or, if you measure density and pressure, you can determine the\n",
    "temperature. However, pressure and temperature are not sufficient to determine\n",
    "every state of the fluid. The {numref}`thermo-isobaric-evaporation` shows the\n",
    "change of the state of a fluid when heat is added continuously in an isobaric\n",
    "(at constant pressure) process.\n",

    "States of the evaporating fluid.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume, the cylinder only contains liquid water. While transferring energy to\n",
    "your system, the temperature of the water has reached the boiling point at some\n",
    "point (the boiling point temperature depends on the pressure of the system). At\n",
    "that point, the water is in the so-called *saturated liquid* state. If you\n",
    "continue to transfer heat to the water, you will notice, that the temperature\n",
    "does not change, but part of the water will evaporate. This state is called\n",
    "*two-phase* because both liquid and gaseous state are present. Only when the\n",
    "last drop of water evaporated (this state is called *saturated steam*) the\n",
    "temperature of the steam will start to increase again if you transfer more\n",
    "energy to the fluid. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "These physical models for fluid properties can be very simple, i.e. for\n",
    "so-called *ideal gases*, or they can be very complex. In our course we will use\n",
    "complex models, but the good news is: Others have implemented the algorithms and\n",
    "shared them as open source software.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the three state variables pressure, temperature and density, other\n",
    "state variables can be of interest. For a number of connected open systems, as\n",
    "they are typically present in technical plants for heat provision, it is\n",
    "important what amount of energy is transported into the system and what amount\n",
    "is transported out of each subsystem to assess the overall performance. A fluid\n",
    "itself always transports energy, therefore we need another state variable to\n",
    "account for energy in such systems. For open systems, this property is the\n",
    "mass-specific *enthalpy* $h$. The enthalpy describes the energy required per\n",
    "mass of a fluid to change the state while flowing through an open system.\n"
