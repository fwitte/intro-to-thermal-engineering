# Introduction to modeling heat pump systems

This introduction covers the fundamentals of thermodynamics required to model
technical thermodynamic systems at the example of heat pumps. The course applies
the theoretical concepts using Python codes and covers an introduction to
fluid property models, different approaches for modeling component based
thermodynamic systems and the implementation of such models in an open source
framework, i.e. [TESPy](https://tespy.readthedocs.io).

The course is an open source project developed by
[Francesco Witte](https://github.com/fwitte). You are invited to contribute to
the project!
