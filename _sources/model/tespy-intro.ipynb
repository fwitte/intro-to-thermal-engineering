    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## General information\n",
    "\n",
    "[TESPy](https://tespy.readthedocs.io) is an open-source framework for the\n",
    "simulation of component based thermodynamic conversion processes. With the\n",
    "software you can use predefined components such as a pump, compressor, heat\n",
    "exchanger, turbine or valve (and many more) to build thermodynamic systems. The\n",
    "system is set up by connecting the components in a generic way and then\n",
    "specifying respective process and component parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software then performs a steady state simulation of your system by creating\n",
    "and solving a system of equations in the *equation oriented (EO)* approach\n",
    "(also see {cite}`Witte2020` and {cite}`Witte2022` as well as the online\n",
    "documentation for more information). The system represents the individual\n",
    "topology and component and process specifications provided by you. TESPy\n",
    "accomplishes this by solving for\n",
    "\n",
    "- mass flow,\n",
    "- pressure and\n",
    "- enthalpy\n",
    "\n",
    "of every connection between two components[^fluid-variable]. After solving a\n",
    "model, missing component and process parameters - for example: efficiencies,\n",
    "temperatures, pressure losses - are determined based on this information. The EO\n",
    "approach lets the modeler choose, which parameters are inputs and which\n",
    "parameters are results: For instance, a compressor efficiency can be an input\n",
    "and the system variables are solved to meet that constraint, or it can be a\n",
    "result of other inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mini example\n",
    "\n",
    "TESPy consists of three main building blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- class `Network` as container of the simulation\n",
    "- class `Component` (children of them: `Compressor`, `Valve`, ...), in which\n",
    "  thermodynamic conversion processes take place\n",
    "- class `Connection`, which define the topology of the `Network`\n",
    "  by connecting the individual components\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will create two simple networks to show the principle of\n",
    "TESPy. For further tutorials and examples we recommend looking into the online\n",
    "documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling a Compressor\n",

    "First, we are modeling a compressor, which compresses fully saturated steam to a\n",
    "higher pressure level. The {numref}`compressor-flowsheet` shows the abstract\n",
